# Smart Grocery Manager

##  Project Overview
**Smart Grocery Manager** is a simple Java program that helps users manage their grocery shopping list. It uses:
- **ArrayLists** to store current grocery items.
- **Arrays** to archive removed/purchased items.
- **File persistence** to save and load data from files (`groceries.txt` and `removedItems.txt`).
- **Recursive input validation** and **exception handling** to ensure reliable user input.

This program was developed as a final project for COSC-1436 course.
